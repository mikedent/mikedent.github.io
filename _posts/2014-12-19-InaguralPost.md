Yes, I am not your typical doctor.  Folks at work call me The Doctor, well because it's an easy nickname with my initials being MD, and for some reason they think I take care of things like a doctor.  So, we'll go with that.

## Goodbye 2014, Hello 2015!
Figured what better way to finish the year off and prepare for the next year than start working on one of my 2015 personal goals!  Each year I try to pick something (technology, language, etc) that I can focus on for the year.  

For 2015 I decided to focus on something I've always wanted to do, but never really wanted to put much effort into it.  Web Programming.  Markdown, Python, Ruby. A Blog.  I figured what better way to force myself to learn these technologies than to start a blog, write about it and other things.  

I decided to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes.

I've been taking a look at [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for a while, and combing Jekyll and Markdown into a  blog, I'm really excited.

So stay tuned, I hope to do some fun things here.  You can catch me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mikedent13)

Thanks!!
