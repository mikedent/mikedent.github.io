Welcome to my site.  I'm a geek, flat out geek.  I love all things technology.

Every year I try to set out to teach myself something new for the year, something that I don't generally work with on a day to day basis.  Seems like every year I try to teach myself something with programming.  I have books dating back to VB6 still, but somehow I never really make anything of it.

* Goal for 2015:  Teach myself a little more about web programming, specifically using Ruby, Python, maybe some Jekyll, if I have time.

I'm using this site to teach myself more about [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and anything else that pops into my head!

Thanks for reading!
